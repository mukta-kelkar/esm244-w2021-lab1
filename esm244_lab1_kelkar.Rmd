### Read in SF Trees Data

```{r}
sf_trees <- read.csv(here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))
```

### Basic wrangling reminders

refresh some skills for data wrangling and & summary statistics using functions in the `dplyr` package

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal_status, do some wrangling, make a graph.

```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  count(legal_status) %>% 
  drop_na(legal_status) %>%    
  rename(tree_count = n) %>%   #new name = old name
  relocate(tree_count) %>%      #moves tree_count to the first column position. can do more variations on relocating
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5) %>% 
  

```
